# pyfft

This is a simple code I cooked up while studying FFT using the fftpack from the scipy library.
It is useful for checking FFT's output based on various inputs such as frequency, sampling rate and number of samples.
It prints FFT bins and plots both signals (wave_1) and (wave_2) at the end.
If you want one frequency only, remove wave_2 from the addition to the x list.
